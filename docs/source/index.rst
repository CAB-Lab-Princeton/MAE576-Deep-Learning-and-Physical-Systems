MAE576 Deep Learing and Physical Systems
===================================

Welcome to **MAE576/432** Deep Leanring for Physical Systems. This course provides an introduction to the application of deep learning to physical problems. 
Topics include convolutional neural networks, and graph neural networks. 
This course provides an introduction to deep learning and its application to physical problems. Students will
gain exposure to the deep learning literature, and experience programming deep learning models. Reading as-
signments will cover graph neural networks, normalizing flows, and reinforcement learning and programming
assignments will provide exposure to the pytorch, pytorch-geometric, and spinning up deep learning (python)
libraries. Students will engage with weekly reading assignments as peer reviewers in a mock conference setup
and with each others code through code reviews.
