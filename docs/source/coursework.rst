Reading Assignments (MAE576 Only)
------------
Reading assignments are reviewing assignments. Papers will be assigned using the EasyChair conference
system and review submission requires an EasyChair account. If you are unfamiliar with EasyChair consider
looking through `these reviewer instructions <https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/events-documents/is2016/submission-is2016_easychair_instruction_for_reviewers_rev_3.pdf?sfvrsn=1e0b82c6_2>`_. 
When writing your review use the following guidelines [1]_.

1. **Read the paper**. It’s important to carefully read through the entire paper. Consider looking up
any related work and citations that will help you comprehensively evaluate it. Be sure to give yourself
sufficient time for this step.

2. **Write a summary**. What is the goal of the paper? Is it to better address a known application
or problem, draw attention to a new application or problem, or to introduce and/or explain a new
theoretical finding? A combination of these? Different objectives will require different considerations
as to potential value and impact.

3. **List strong points**. Is the submission clear, technically correct, experimentally rigorous, reproducible,
does it present novel findings (e.g. theoretically, algorithmically, etc.)?

4. **List weak points**. Is it weak in any of the aspects listed in (2)?

5. **Future directions**. Think through and propose an extension, novel application or an additional
experiment for the work presented with justification.

6. **Submit your review**. Submit your review at the MAE 432/576: Deep Learning and Physical Systems
(Spring 2023) EasyChair conference site.

7. **Engage in discussion (optional)**. Respond to at least one of your classmates’ reviews by submitting
a comment. Be positive and generous. Consider the following in your response to the review and
proposed future direction: |br|
    - Strong and weak points. Be as comprehensive as possible
    - Questions you would like answered to help clarify your understanding.
    - Additional feedback with the aim to improve the review or proposed future direction.

Programming Assignments
------------
Programming assignments are also reviewing assignments. If you are unfamiliar with the code review pro-
cess, consider looking through `this take on code reviews <https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/09/30/how-to-make-good-code-reviews-better/>`_. When giving your review consider the following
guidelines [2]_:

1. **Read the code**. Note strong and weak points. Suggest alternatives or possible workarounds when
appropriate.
    - **Strong points**. Is the code unusually elegant or creative?
    - **Weak points**. Is the code repetitive (remember DRY, Don’t Repeat Yourself)? Is there disagreement between code and specification? Are there magic numbers? Are bad variable or method names used? Is too much packed into one line of code, or a single function? Is obscure code adequately commented? Are functions and classes well `documented <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_?

2. **Engage in discussion**: Consider including the following when responding to your reviewer:
    - **Constructivity**: Is the review helpful? Does it explain how to improve the code?
    - **Specificity**: Does the review point to specific things in the code?
    - **Tone**: Is the tone of the review positive and generous?

Programming Projects
------------
The programming projects are intended to give you the opportunity to independently explore the application
of deep learning libraries explored in this class (i.e., `pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, 
`pytorch-geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, 
and `spinning up <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`_) to physical
problems. Your written report should be clear and concise and typed up either using latex (preferred) or
Word. The report should contain relevant calculations, citations, and visualizations. Please make sure to
annotate and explain everything you include. For your oral presentation, please present so that the material
is clear, concise and accessible to the whole class. |br|
You are free to choose a topic for your project according to your interest. Your work may complement your
current research but it should not be a repeat of something you have already done in your research. You are
encouraged to contact me to discuss your ideas for possible topics. Some options for types of projects you
may consider are described below.
