Reading Assignments (MAE576 Only)
------------
Reading assignments are reviewing assignments. Papers will be assigned using the EasyChair conference
system and review submission requires an EasyChair account. If you are unfamiliar with EasyChair consider
looking through `these reviewer instructions <https://www.incose.org/docs/default-source/events-documents/is2016/submission-is2016_easychair_instruction_for_reviewers_rev_3.pdf?sfvrsn=1e0b82c6_2>`_. 
When writing your review use the following guidelines [1]_.

1. **Read the paper**. It’s important to carefully read through the entire paper. Consider looking up
any related work and citations that will help you comprehensively evaluate it. Be sure to give yourself
sufficient time for this step.

2. **Write a summary**. What is the goal of the paper? Is it to better address a known application
or problem, draw attention to a new application or problem, or to introduce and/or explain a new
theoretical finding? A combination of these? Different objectives will require different considerations
as to potential value and impact.

3. **List strong points**. Is the submission clear, technically correct, experimentally rigorous, reproducible,
does it present novel findings (e.g. theoretically, algorithmically, etc.)?

4. **List weak points**. Is it weak in any of the aspects listed in (2)?

5. **Future directions**. Think through and propose an extension, novel application or an additional
experiment for the work presented with justification.

6. **Submit your review**. Submit your review at the MAE 432/576: Deep Learning and Physical Systems
(Spring 2023) EasyChair conference site.

7. **Engage in discussion (optional)**. Respond to at least one of your classmates’ reviews by submitting
a comment. Be positive and generous. Consider the following in your response to the review and
proposed future direction:
    a) Strong and weak points. Be as comprehensive as possible
    b) Questions you would like answered to help clarify your understanding.
    c) Additional feedback with the aim to improve the review or proposed future direction.
