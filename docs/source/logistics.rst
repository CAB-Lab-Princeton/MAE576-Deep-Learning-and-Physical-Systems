Academic Integrity
------------
Programming is an individual creative process much like composition. You must reach your own under-
standing of the problem and discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with other people
are permitted and encouraged. However, when the time comes to write code that solves the problem, such
discussions (except with course staff members) are no longer appropriate: the code must be your own work.
If you have a question about how to use some feature of Python, the operating system, or some other rele-
vant application, you can certainly ask your friends or the instructors, but specific questions about code you
have written must be treated more carefully. For each assignment, you must specifically describe in your
README.md file, whatever help (if any) that you received from others and tell us the names of any individuals
with whom you collaborated. This includes help from friends, classmates, and course instructors.

Do not, under any circumstances, copy another person’s code. Incorporating someone else’s code into your
program in any form is a violation of academic regulations. This includes adapting solutions or partial
solutions to assignments from any offering of this course or any other course. Abetting plagiarism or unau-
thorized collaboration by ”sharing” your code is also prohibited. Sharing code in digital form is an especially
egregious violation: do not e-mail your code or make your source files available to anyone. There is one
exception to the code-sharing rule: You may adapt code from course materials provided that you explain
what code you use, and cite its source in your comments.

Novices often have the misconception that copying and mechanically transforming a program (by rearrang-
ing independent code, renaming variables, or similar operations) makes it something different. Actually,
identifying plagiarized source code is easier than you might think. Not only does plagiarized code quickly
identify itself as part of the grading process, but also we can turn to software packages (such as Alex Aiken’s
renowned MOSS software) for automatic help.

This policy supplements the University’s academic regulations, making explicit what constitutes a violation
for this course. Princeton Rights, Rules, Responsibilities handbook asserts:

   The only adequate defense for a student accused of an academic violation is that the work in
   question does not, in fact, constitute a violation. Neither the defense that the student was
   ignorant of the regulations concerning academic violations nor the defense that the student was
   under pressure at the time the violation was committed is considered an adequate defense.

If you have any questions about these matters, please consult a course staff member. Violators will be
referred to the Committee on Discipline for review; if found guilty, you will receive an F as a course grade
plus whatever disciplinary action the Committee imposes.

Mental Health Resources
------------
Undergraduate students may experience a range of emotional and psychological challenges that can interfere
with their learning. Strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance or alcohol abuse, depression, diffi-
culty concentrating and/or lack of motivation are frequently responses to significant stress. Mental health
concerns caused by stressful circumstances that influence your life out of class might affect the quality your
academic work and otherwise impede your happiness on campus. Princeton makes available numerous ser-
vices to help support you through difficult moments. You can learn more about confidential mental health ser-
vices available on campus at `<https://uhs.princeton.edu/counseling-psychological-services>`_. Sup-
port is available 24-hours-a-day from Counseling and Psychological Services; if your concern is urgent, this
link will take you to appropriate care: `<https://uhs.princeton.edu/counseling-psychological-services/>`_

Disability Services and Academic Accommodations
------------
Students must register with the Office of Disability Services (ods@princeton.edu; 258-8840) for disability
verification and determination of eligibility for reasonable academic accommodations. Requests for academic
accommodations for this course should be made at the beginning of the semester, or as soon as possible
for newly-approved students. I encourage students with approved accommodations to contact me at the
beginning of the semester, and again before major course assessments. Please note that no accommodations
for a disability will be made without authorization from ODS, or without advance notice.
